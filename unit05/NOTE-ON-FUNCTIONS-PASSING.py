# If the parameter is type int, float, or string, then it's passed by value (a copy is given to the function as
# opposed to the original object). This means that any changes made to the value of the parameter within the function
# will NOT change the value the variable holds outside of/after calling the function


# If the parameter is list or dictionary, then it's passed by reference (the original is given to the function). This
# means any changes made to the parameter within the function changes the value the variable holds outside/after
# calling it
